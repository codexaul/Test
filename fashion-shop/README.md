# Lux Muslim Fashion

This is a simple online fashion store built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and Tailwind CSS. It showcases modest fashion products with smooth animations powered by [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then start the development server (Node.js 18 or newer recommended):

```bash
npm run dev
```

The `dev` script uses the standard Next.js development server rather than
Turbopack to avoid stability issues some environments experience.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the site.

## Features

- Animated product grid powered by GSAP
- Tailwind CSS styling with an elegant "Lux Muslim Fashion" brand theme
- Remote image configuration for Unsplash in `next.config.ts`

## Building

To create a production build run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then start the server with `npm start`.
